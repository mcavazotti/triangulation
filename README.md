# Triangulation
Triangulation of simple polygons in C++

## About this project
I made this program for an school assignment in 2021. The algorithm is based on the one described in **Computational Geometry: Algorithms and Applications** (third ed.). I had to do some adaptations since the algorithm in the book was described in rather high-level terms.

This repository contains:
- the source code
- some test cases
- a script in Python to see the results
- the assignment instructions (in Portuguese)
